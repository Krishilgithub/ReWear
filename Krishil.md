# Krishil's Contributions to Closet Circle Exchange

## Overview

This document details my (Krishil's) contributions to the Closet Circle Exchange project, the challenges encountered during development, and how I addressed them. It also references my previous work in the Odoo Hackathon 2025 repository.

## Major Contributions

### 1. **Database & Backend Integration**

- Designed and implemented the Prisma schema for storing item details, including support for images and user associations.
- Set up API endpoints for item creation, retrieval, and user profile management.
- Integrated backend with the frontend, ensuring seamless data flow and persistence.

### 2. **Frontend Features & Dynamic Data**

- Refactored the profile page to load and persist user data, including photo upload and dynamic stats (points, items listed, swaps).
- Made the dashboard and all item-related pages (Browse Items, My Items) fully dynamic, fetching data from the backend or localStorage for local development.
- Implemented localStorage-only mode for local development, including seeding with sample items and ensuring all CRUD operations work offline.

### 3. **Authentication & Routing**

- Fixed sign-up and sign-in redirect behavior to keep users on the landing page.
- Diagnosed and resolved Google OAuth errors by correcting Google Cloud Console settings and environment variables.
- Updated protected routes and conditional navigation based on authentication state.

### 4. **AI Integration**

- Integrated an AI-powered autocomplete (ModelPredictor) for product details on the Add Item page, improving user experience and data entry speed.

### 5. **UI/UX Improvements**

- Ensured the Featured Items section and navigation work correctly based on user authentication state.
- Fixed issues with blank or empty pages by properly handling async data fetching and error states.

### 6. **Deployment & Production Readiness**

- Provided step-by-step instructions for deploying the backend and database to Vercel, including environment variable setup and Prisma migrations.

## Problems Faced & Solutions

### Problem: Blank Pages and Data Not Loading

- **Cause:** Async data fetching was not properly awaited, leading to empty or blank pages.
- **Solution:** Refactored data services and components to use async/await and robust error handling.

### Problem: Google OAuth Errors

- **Cause:** Misconfiguration in Google Cloud Console and missing/incorrect environment variables.
- **Solution:** Updated OAuth credentials, callback URLs, and environment variables to match deployment settings.

### Problem: Local Development Fails Without Backend

- **Cause:** Frontend attempted to fetch from non-existent local API endpoints.
- **Solution:** Switched all item CRUD operations to use localStorage for local development, with sample data seeding.

### Problem: Static Profile Data

- **Cause:** Profile page was not connected to dynamic data sources.
- **Solution:** Refactored profile page to load and persist user data, including photo upload and stats, using localStorage.

### Problem: Navigation and Auth State Issues

- **Cause:** Navigation and protected routes did not always reflect authentication state.
- **Solution:** Updated components to use authentication context and conditional navigation.

## Previous Contributions: Odoo Hackathon 2025

- Contributed to the Odoo Hackathon 2025 repository, focusing on backend integration, authentication, and UI improvements.
- Experience from that project informed many architectural and problem-solving decisions in Closet Circle Exchange.

## Summary

Throughout the Closet Circle Exchange project, I focused on building robust, dynamic, and user-friendly features, solving integration and deployment challenges, and ensuring a smooth development experience for both local and production environments.
