## üìä Analytics Setup

### **Google Analytics Setup**

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)

4. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in `index.html` with your actual Measurement ID
5. Deploy the changes

### **Vercel Analytics Setup**

1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Navigate to "Analytics" tab
3. Enable "Web Analytics" (requires Pro plan)
4. The script is already included in your `index.html`

## üîß Configuration Files

### **vercel.json** (Already Created)

```json
{
	"buildCommand": "npm run build",
	"outputDirectory": "dist",
	"framework": "vite",
	"rewrites": [
		{
			"source": "/(.*)",
			"destination": "/index.html"
		}
	],
	"headers": [
		{
			"source": "/(.*)",
			"headers": [
				{
					"key": "X-Content-Type-Options",

## üåç Environment Variables

### **Required Environment Variables**

Set these in your Vercel dashboard under "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables":

```bash
# Google Analytics (replace with your actual ID)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# API URLs (if you have backend)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-ws-domain.com

# Authentication (if using auth providers)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
```

### **How to Set Environment Variables**

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable with the appropriate environment (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Redeploy your project

## üìà Performance Optimization

### **Build Optimization**

- Your project already uses Vite for fast builds
- Code splitting is automatically handled
- Tree shaking removes unused code

### **Caching Strategy**

- Static assets are cached for 1 year (configured in vercel.json)
- API responses can be cached using Vercel's Edge Caching

### **CDN Distribution**

- Vercel automatically distributes your assets globally
- Images and static files are served from the edge

---

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### **Vercel Analytics Dashboard**

- View real-time performance metrics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track user interactions
- Analyze page load times

### **Google Analytics Dashboard**

- Track user behavior
- Monitor conversion rates
- Analyze traffic sources
- View custom events (sign-ups, item views, etc.)

### **Custom Events Tracking**

Your app tracks these events automatically:

- User sign-ups and sign-ins
- Item interactions (views, likes, swaps)
- Navigation patterns
- Form submissions and errors

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Build Failures**

```bash
# Check build locally first
npm run build

# Common fixes:
npm install
npm run lint --fix
```

#### **Analytics Not Working**

1. Verify Google Analytics ID is correct
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure ad blockers are disabled for testing
4. Verify Vercel Analytics is enabled in dashboard

#### **Environment Variables Not Loading**

1. Check variable names start with `VITE_` for client-side access
2. Redeploy after adding new environment variables
3. Verify variables are set for the correct environment

### **Performance Issues**

1. Check Vercel Analytics for Core Web Vitals
2. Optimize images and assets
3. Enable compression in vercel.json
4. Use lazy loading for components

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### **Automatic Deployments**

- Every push to `main` branch triggers production deployment
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Branch deployments for testing

### **Deployment Status**

- Monitor deployments in Vercel dashboard
- Set up notifications for deployment status
- Configure deployment protection rules

---

## üìä Analytics Events

### **Tracked Events**

Your app automatically tracks:

- Page views
- User authentication (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out)
- Item interactions (view, like, swap request)
- Navigation events
- Form submissions and errors

### **Custom Event Examples**

```typescript
// Track item view
trackEvent("item_view", "engagement", itemId);

// Track swap request
trackEvent("swap_request", "conversion", itemId);

// Track search
trackEvent("search_performed", "engagement", searchTerm);
```
